# Prevents SYSPREP from freezing at "Getting Ready" on first boot                          #
# NOTE, DMWAPPUSHSERVICE is a Keyboard and Ink telemetry service, and potential keylogger. #
# It is recommended to disable this service in new builds, but SYSPREP will freeze/fail    #
# if the service is not running. If SYSPREP will be used, add a FirstBootCommand to your   #
# build to disable the service.                                                            #
